## 📋 How to Use

### Running Code:
1. Click on any problem from the DSA Race Track
2. Go to the **"Solve"** tab
3. Select your preferred programming language
4. Write your solution in the code editor
5. (Optional) Add test input in the "Custom Input" section
6. Click **"RUN CODE"** button
7. View output in real-time

### Accessing Platforms:
1. Open any problem
2. Click on the **"LeetCode / Codeforces / CodeChef"** tab
3. For each platform:
   - 🔍 **Search**: Find the exact problem on the platform
   - **→ Visit**: Go directly to the platform to explore similar problems
4. Links open in new tabs (no disruption to your coding session)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Compiler API Integration
- **Endpoint**: Judge0 Community API (free tier)

- **CodeChef**: Problem search + ongoing contests
- **Security**: All links open in new tabs with `rel="noreferrer"` for safety

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### Output Status Colors:
- 🟢 **Green (#00e676)**: Code executed successfully
- 🔴 **Red (#ff5252)**: Compilation or runtime error
- ⚪ **Gray**: No execution result yet

### Platform Buttons:
- 🟨 **Yellow (Search)**: Direct problem search with pre-filled query
- 🟢 **Green (Visit)**: Direct platform access to browse

## 📱 Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full feature display with all elements visible
